I am working on automotive industory and I change car every 2 to 3 years for enjyoing latest car technology with the latest car models. After several research, I decided to choose the used car price detecion,  reason why I choose this dataset because resale value is important if sell a car and purchase new one, analyze factors to sell at higher price is interesting!
